# **Experiment Tracking & Model Management**

### **Experiment Tracking**
- Experiment tracking is the process of keeping track of all the relevant information from an **ML experiment**, which includes source code, environment, data, model, hyperparameters, metrics, etc.


### **MLflow**
- An open source platform for the machine learning lifecycle. It's a python package that can be installed with pip and it contains four main modules:
	- Tracking.
	- Models.
	- Model Registry.
	- Projects.

### **Model Management in MLFlow**
- The Model Registry component is a centralized model store, set of APIs, and a UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model. 
- It provides:
   - Model lineage.
   - Model versioning.
   - Stage transitions.
   - Annotations.

### **MLflowClient Class**
- A client of an MLflow Tracking Server creates and manages experiments and runs.
- A client of an MLflow Registry Server creates and manages registered models and model versions. 


### **MLflow Configuration**
- MLflow configuration is a set of key-value pairs that are used to configure MLflow.
- MLflow configuration is stored in a file called **mlflow-config.yaml**.
